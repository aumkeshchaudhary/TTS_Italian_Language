# Fine-tuning SpeechT5 TTS Model for Italian

                  Aumkeshchy2003/Italian_TTS

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to fine-tuning the SpeechT5 Text-to-Speech (TTS) model on Italian language datasets. The goal is to adapt Microsoftâ€™s SpeechT5 model to generate Italian speech from text, leveraging the power of the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Introduction

SpeechT5 is a powerful model designed by Microsoft for Text-to-Speech tasks. It has demonstrated superior performance in many languages, but here, we aim to fine-tune it specifically for Italian. This README explains the process of preparing data, setting up the environment, fine-tuning the model, and generating Italian speech.
Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.7+
    PyTorch >= 1.9.0
    Transformers >= 4.28.0
    Datasets
    torchaudio
    librosa
    numpy
    gradio (for inference demo)

You can install the required packages by running:

    pip install torch transformers datasets torchaudio librosa gradio

**Dataset Preparation**

For fine-tuning the TTS model, we need an Italian language dataset. Ensure that your dataset is structured in a format compatible with Hugging Face datasets library.

Each data point should include:

    text: The input Italian text to be spoken.
    audio: The corresponding speech waveform.

You can preprocess your dataset like this:

    import librosa
    from datasets import Dataset

    # Example: Loading an Italian dataset
    dataset = Dataset.from_dict({
       "text": ["Ciao, come stai?", "Buongiorno a tutti!"],
       "audio": ["path_to_audio_file1.wav", "path_to_audio_file2.wav"]
      })

    # Load the audio
    def load_audio(batch):
        speech_array, sampling_rate = librosa.load(batch["audio"], sr=16000)
        batch["speech_array"] = speech_array
        batch["sampling_rate"] = sampling_rate
        return batch

    dataset = dataset.map(load_audio)

**Model Fine-tuning**
***Steps***

    1. Initialize the model and tokenizer:

     from transformers import SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech, SpeechT5Processor
     import torch
     # Load the pre-trained SpeechT5 model and processor
     model = SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")
     processor = SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")

   2. Prepare for fine-tuning:
    
    Make sure your dataset and model inputs are correctly processed.

   3. Train the model:

    from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
    # Define training arguments
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
      output_dir="./results",
      per_device_train_batch_size=2,
      num_train_epochs=3,
      logging_dir='./logs',
      save_steps=500,
    )

    # Initialize Trainer
     trainer = Trainer(
       model=model,
       args=training_args,
       train_dataset=dataset,
      )

    # Train the model
     trainer.train()

   4. Save the model:

    After fine-tuning, save your model for later inference.

    model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_speecht5_italian")
    processor.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_speecht5_italian")

**Usage**

Once the model is fine-tuned, you can generate Italian speech from any text.

    from transformers import SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech, SpeechT5Processor
    import torch
    import gradio as gr

    # Load fine-tuned model
    model = SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_speecht5_italian")
    processor = SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_speecht5_italian")

    def tts_infer(text):
      inputs = processor(text, return_tensors="pt")
      speech = model.generate(**inputs)
      return speech

    # Run demo using Gradio
     demo = gr.Interface(fn=tts_infer, inputs="text", outputs="audio")
     demo.launch()

**Results**

After fine-tuning, you should be able to generate realistic Italian speech. Further improvements can be achieved by experimenting with the dataset, hyperparameters, and training epochs.
